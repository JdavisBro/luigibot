# luigibot
## A bot to replicate /r/askouija on Discord
This bot replicates /r/askouija where people can only respond with one letter at a time and must create a phrase to respond to the question/statment said.
-To ask a question use o!ask (question). If you want a fill in the blanks part in your question add '{}' where you want the blank.
-To end the question you type 'goodbye' or 'Goodbye' and it will mention the user that asked the question saying the answer in an embed
## To work the channel must:
* Be named 'ask-ouija'
* Luigi must have permissions to, read messages, read message history, send messages, add reactions and manage messages.

### Role Pinging
There is also a feature to have a role that will get pinged when a new Question begins, to make this role it needs to be named 'Luigi' and luigibot must have to ability to give roles and be above it.

If you would like to host the bot yourself, clone the thing and run luigi.py either through the start.sh file already there (which you need to edit to add your bot token) or by running `python3 luigi.py 'BOT TOKEN'`
