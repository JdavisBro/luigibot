# LuigiBot (o!)
## A bot to replicate /r/askouija on Discord
This bot replicates /r/askouija where people can only respond with one letter at a time and must create a phrase to respond to the question/statment said.
- To ask a question use o!ask (question). If you want a fill in the blanks part in your question add '{}' where you want the blank.
- To help respond to a question say any character or 'space'
- To end the question you type 'goodbye' or 'Goodbye' and it will mention the user that asked the question saying the answer in an embed
## To work the channel must be named:
- ask-ouija

- Manage Messages (in that channel)
  - To delete messages that don't fit the format (1 letter, space or goodbye)

## Self Hosting

If you would like to host the bot yourself, clone the thing and run luigi.py either through the start.sh file already there (which you need to edit to add your bot token) or by running `python3 luigi.py 'BOTTOKEN'` or `python3 luigi.py BOTTOKEN` (sometimes with ' it doesn't work idk why lol)
