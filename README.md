A bot to replicate /r/askouija on Discord
LuigiBot, an ask ouija bot
This bot replicates /r/askouija where people can only respond with one letter at a time and must create a phrase to respond to the question/statment said.

To ask a question use o!ask (question). If you want a fill in the blanks part in your question add '{}' where you want the blank.

To work the channel must:
Be named 'ask-ouija'
Luigi must have permissions to, read messages, read message history, send messages, add reactions and manage messages.
There is also a feature to have a role that will get pinged when a new Question begins, to make this role it needs to be named 'Luigi' and luigibot must have to ability to give roles and be above it.
