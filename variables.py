I am a robot to replicate r/askouija on discord.\nTo be used I require a channel with one of the names as said on my github page's readme <https://www.github.com/jdavisbro/luigibot> permissions that I require or that are optional are also stated on that page. \nAfter that is sorted, asking a question is easy! Just go into the channel and type `{0}ask QUESTION` and I will wait for responses and add them.\nThe responses I look for are any one letter character (besides {{ and }}), 'space' for adding a space :| and goodbye for ending a question.\nOnce a question is ended I will pin the message to the channel, there is a limit to 50 pins though so I can't pin them all!\nThank you for coming to my TED talk. My prefix in this server is `{0}`" #The help message that sends when somenone pings luigi. {0} is the server prefix.
